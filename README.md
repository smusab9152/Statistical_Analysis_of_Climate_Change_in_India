# Statistical_Analysis_of_Climate_Change_in_India
Statistical Analysis of Climate Change in India 🌍📊
Overview: This project analyzes temperature change data in India from 1901 to 2020, focusing on identifying trends, regional variations, and predicting future changes. Completed as part of my MSc in Big Data Analytics.

Key Objectives:

🔍 Analyze temperature variations across different regions of India.
📅 Study temperature trends over time, focusing on the last two decades.
🌡️ Compare seasonal variations and regional impacts of climate change.
Techniques Used:

📈 Descriptive Statistics: Mean, median, variance, skewness, kurtosis.
🧪 Hypothesis Testing: Z-test, T-test, ANOVA for comparing regional and seasonal changes.
🔗 Linear Regression: To model temperature trends.
📊 ARIMA Modeling: To forecast future temperature changes.
🎨 Data Visualization: Histograms, heatmaps, scatter plots, and line graphs.
Key Insights:

🌡️ Significant temperature rise, especially over the last two decades.
🌍 Regional differences, with some zones warming faster.
🔮 ARIMA model predicts continued temperature increases.
Tools and Libraries:

🐍 Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, StatsModels, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
📓 Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and visualization.
Conclusion: The analysis shows a clear warming trend in India, consistent with global climate change patterns. These findings highlight the need for urgent sustainable actions to combat rising temperatures in India. 🌱
